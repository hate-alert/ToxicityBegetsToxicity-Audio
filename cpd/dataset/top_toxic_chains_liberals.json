In Part 1, I am joined first by our new Swedish leader of Waystar Alexander Skarsgard, and later the incredible Jeremy Strong is back to discuss his character's ultimate fate and what Kendall really wanted all along. Later this week, Part 2 will have my extended conversation with director and executive producer Mark Mylod, who helped shepherd the perfect conclusion to this tragic family story and also be sharing my own closing thoughts about these kids who just didn't get hugged enough. This finale, titled With Open Eyes, was of course written by series creator Jesse Armstrong.

And two years ago, the premise of the podcast, which is what makes it funny, is that of the three hosts, two of the hosts do not know who the secret guest is. Jason Feynman. I'm sorry, Erin knows. I actually said Erin a video last night of me just laughing because I was like, you have to know how funny I think this is. Jason Feynman's computer lost a shit while they were trying to record. And Matthew McConaughey, who was the guest, was in the waiting room while Jason Bateman is losing his mind and it's all recorded. And my favorite part is he says, we have to cancel and reschedule. I'm in a tailspin. I'm in a fucking tailspin. And if you have ever been a guest on a podcast or you are a host of a podcast, you feel this intensely. And the best part was as he is",

There was just absolutely no reason for him to make those comments about female and black musicians to the New York Times, but he was swiftly removed from the Board of Directors of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation after those comments went public. He's really just lighting his legacy on fire on his way out. Something that I think this silver lining here is that anybody who believed that black artists and female artists were being excluded from Rolling Stone for like a reason and that Rolling Stone objectively knew who was good and who wasn't good. This blows that theory completely out of the water. It was literally a fucking bigoted guy who was the gatekeeper of what was considered good rock and roll music, deciding that Black people and women were not good enough.",

For example, Indiana Congressman Jim Banks tweeted in total sincerity, not as a joke. Have we ever seen a president attack and malign the free press like Joe Biden has? Only one of two things can be happening here, either he's trolling us, because Trump's record of antagonism toward the press is so obvious that he knows a comment like that will drive the rest of us insane, or he's got some sort of Benjamin button disease where he looks like a middle-aged man, but was actually born like a few months ago, and legitimately doesn't know who Donald Trump is.

And two years ago, the premise of the podcast, which is what makes it funny, is that of the three hosts, two of the hosts do not know who the secret guest is. Jason Feynman. I'm sorry, Erin knows. I actually said Erin a video last night of me just laughing because I was like, you have to know how funny I think this is. Jason Feynman's computer lost a shit while they were trying to record. And Matthew McConaughey, who was the guest, was in the waiting room while Jason Bateman is losing his mind and it's all recorded. And my favorite part is he says, we have to cancel and reschedule. I'm in a tailspin. I'm in a fucking tailspin. And if you have ever been a guest on a podcast or you are a host of a podcast, you feel this intensely. And the best part was as he is",

The fact that the entire grand jury had recommendations for indictment said that people were lying and that there was zero evidence of election fraud. That's important because that's what Fawney Willis needs and that's what any subsequent grand jury needs of a going to issue an indictment.

In the same way that like my friends went to law school and the end of it they have to like study for the bar and find out what the law actually is because they spent three years like learning about philosophical nonsense. I think it is crazy that you graduate high school in this country and then you find out what taxes are. They should teach about taxes. It's fucking nuts. I agree with that. Now we all the same page for that. Well that's a great place to leave it. It is.  Give it up for Lou now, should we back?",

Here's the premise. What if California seceded from the United States? If it did, what would happen? Would it usher in a new era of peace and prosperity or plunge the US into a new civil war? This is the last resort, a new documentary podcast following the rise, fall and rebirth of Cal exit, the campaign for Californian independence. It's a story about a dream for a new progressive utopia on the west coast. It's about the fight for America's future. And it's also a tale of two friends who started on the political fringe and ended up in the middle of a still unfolding global criminal conspiracy involving the FBI and Russian intelligence.

And he tweeted about his commitments today, which included not allowing anyone who was de-platformed, you know, like Trump or Kanye back on the platform until there was a clear process for doing so. And including the civil rights community in a content moderation council that they're developing, Kanye Shrug. Good for them for holding",

Number one, and high as fuck on the list. Lula wins the election in Brazil in a victory for fucking humanity. Okay. This week's news about Brazil was like a breath of fresh air for those of us who have been concerned about this racist right wing conservative movement gaining steam across the globe. Now, in one of the closest races I've seen in a minute, leftist candidate Louise Inacio Lula de Silva, eat out a victory over current president, Hire Bolsonaro. Now, in the last presidential election, Lula de Silva was barred from even running for president because he was in jail and would appear to be politically motivated charges of taking a bribe or some shit for like construction contracts. Now, those charges mysteriously disappeared, but hey, we know what the far right is known for doing",

But stay tuned for more news about the changes in Brazil as they unfold. You can always, as usual, find those here. Other things Lady loves this week, elections, which are coming next week, like on Tuesday and shit. And after months of organizing and agonizing to be honest, elections are upon us. This has started to become one of Lady's favorite times of year, as finally we can get some damn resolution and see if our organizing paid off. Kind of like tending a garden and checking for fruit. Now, I can't emphasize enough how important these elections are, and I am telling you without a hint of drama, and I mean, not a hint, that what is at stake in the selection cycle is whether or not we are on a path to having more elections, or none at all.",

On the ballot are the people who make the rules about whether or not you can vote and under what conditions. Those people are the Secretary of State. Also, the people who sign or don't sign laws that you care about once they've been negotiated by your representatives, those are your governors. They are also on the ballot. who represents you in Congress is on the ballot. So vote. It takes literally no time at all to secure your future. Plus you get a cool sticker and you get to be on the right side of history. Imagine that. If you want more information on what's on the ballot and who is on the ballot in your state and what they do, go to www.blackthenumber2thefuture.org.

Some of them mine, but most of them do to some of y'all and your weird ass behavior, just to keep it a buck. But all of this to say, my best advice here is to swim with the tide and not against it. Now here's what I mean by that. Babe, you feel what you feel and you're feelings. Babe, wrong. It doesn't mean they're not temporary. It doesn't mean they're bad. It just means they're your feelings. And every moment you are breathing, you get to decide what it is that you do or don't do with those feelings and with whom. So, if you're tired of dating, stop and date yourself. At the end of the day, you've always got yourself to come back to. Now, you're going to know when you're ready to get back out there in the streets. Just give yourself",

And, you know, maybe therapy isn't for everyone, but it certainly is for some of us and for me, myself. I go in and out of the dating scene as appropriate, based on what I'm noticing about myself and how I'm showing up for myself. I actually am really working on this reciprocity thing because some of y'all got me fucked up, getting too much from me, and I'm not actually receiving enough. But with each instance, I take what I know and I grow. So, I'm here for dating, even with all the ups and downs, with the caveat that the only thing you can do",

And Chris Christie being a dupe was like, let's think of lists of professional Republicans who are qualified for the job. And they put together a big binder and they did this whole process. And then Trump won. And the next day, I believe, Steve Bannon fired Chris Christie and performatively through the binder into the trash can, literally in the office. And they started from scratch.

They have figured out through this sort of creative evil way that they think they can purge basically 50,000 people from the government, career civil servants, good people, professional civil servants, Republicans and Democrats, and do a great job. And so that might sound sort of like in the weeds and wonky, but just imagine you have 50,000 Stephen Miller's at the EPA, the FBI, the Department of Justice, CIA, like DOD, all these places. And so, you know, We were not saved in 2017, but it helped us in 2017 that these guys didn't know what they were doing, and it took them a while to get up and running.

This is not the first of it. He threw a tournament during the first like 2020 wave of COVID, basically being like, fuck you, I don't believe in this. And then a bunch of people got sick from it. He has been critical of Naomi Osaka. He was even critical of Simone Biles during her Olympic run. He has been  critical of Serena Williams and her quote-unquote outbursts and then he aligned with the ball really hard in the neck. He says he did not mean to do it on purpose and I don't think he did mean to do it on purpose but it just fits so well with what he had been doing on purpose.",

And even if this lectern exists, which no one actually thinks it does, who spends $20,000 on a lectern, especially where Arkansas would be helpful to have someone who's, quote unquote, fiscally conservative, which she's absolutely not, or where Arkansas is between 45 and 50 and a lot of metrics from education to health care and other types of services. We're spending $20,000 on a lectern that you don't even use. Even if it was a valid purchase, which no one really thinks it is, it would be a highly questionable expenditure. But Sarah Huckabee Sanders seems to just ignore it all, doesn't care, and tries to change the subject. And she banned woke words recently. So she did that to try to distract. She gave a whole speech, we are banning woke words in Arkansas. No more woke, no",

I'd like to tell you about Moink. That's Mooh plus Oink. Moink delivers grass-fed and grass-finished beef and land, pastured pork and chicken, and sustainable wild-caught Alaskan salmon straight to your door.

I love that Moink is helping save rural America, and I know that you will too. Join the Moink movement today. Shark Tank host Kevin O'Leary called Moink's bacon, the best bacon he's ever tasted, and ring doorbell founder Jamie Siminoff jumped at the chance to invest in Moink.

And I also would be willing to bet that that's why these clowns got recorded because somebody could not believe they motherfucking ears. Now,",

So the app didn't stop at releasing a catchy video. They made it so that you can match with other singles based on the policy issues you care about. And added an election center to increase black engagement by getting all the news you can use about how to get to the polls and how to get your vote on. We are 30 days out. Less than that from the midterm elections. And this here is right on time. So go check it out for yourselves and do not. I repeat, do not forget to vote.

Nope. So I cut it off. Even though the sex was amazing, the other shit made it way too complicated and I got clearer that actually they couldn't separate the shit out.

I don't even know what was happening. Sean Hannity asked him about the, you know, what the president had said and what he said back. And he could have been like, he's a son of a bitch, or I'm standing up for whatever. He could have said anything. And instead he said, you know, he called me, we had a really nice conversation.

But if Republicans don't address mental illness in schools, and they can't blame guns for school shootings, maybe, I mean just maybe, they will explore ways to pass more red flag laws.

The laws vary from state to state, but it may be time that we undertook the difficult fucking task of passing red flag laws nationally.

They start statements with, I'm a Christian, and when I hear about these shootings, the first thing I do is pray. I don't politicize the violence. I pray. Well, fuck that. I call bullshit. And I call bullshit because I'm a Jew, and I pray when incidents like the Nashville shooting occur as well. But then I do something about it. I mean, when these asshole praying people blame absolutely everything for the murders of school children, But the guns that kill them, I mean, it makes you wonder how stupid they think we are.

So underneath this is a fight about, yes, for these workers at these plants right now, but also for the future of the industry and  You know, it's not just about Ford and GM and Chrysler versus these workers in this negotiation. It's them collectively trying to make sure in the same way that the US auto industry faced competition from Japanese cars in the 70s and 80s and faced a crisis in 2008. It's can they get to the other side of this and work together to make sure that US companies and union workers are the ones that make these cars.",

This was, as I was reading all of these, just like ridiculous narratives after it's so obvious what actually took place because it's in front of our eyes that the media was spreading. This is what I wrote. The lesson from all the recent special elections and the recent November 7 election is actually not that America is a very divided country. Americans simply want normalcy and actually share a lot in common. It is the media in search of conflict and ratings combined with self-interested provocateurs in search of power and self-aggrandizement who sow the seeds of division among Americans so that authoritarianism can fill the void.

Just think about how the party already is just totally authoritarian. The authoritarian leader doesn't feel that he even needs to show up to a debate.

The thing that this all turns on to some degree is the possessory interest that Trump supposedly has in some of these documents. He's trying to get some of these documents returned to him. He wants to, you know, go through these documents because he thinks there's potential privilege arguments, even though he hasn't actually articulated what potential privilege there may be and also fails to do so before the special master. But the whole possessory interesting is interesting because how could Trump as a former president have any possessory interest and executive branch documents that belong to the government? and have classified markings on them and arise to the standard of national defense information.

My mom was contemplating on filing a 2255 motion to reopen my case, despite the fact that I'm done simply because I have so much documentation now and much of it I share in the book talking about the weaponization of the Justice Department to be Donald's law firm, to be Donald's Ray Donovan, to be their fixer. It's a real problem. It's more than just about myself. It's about what happens again when you have someone who doesn't want to be the president that they actually want to be the autocrat. They want to be the ruler of the country and how they go about doing it. It's really to ensure that what happened to me never happens ever again to anyone else. So let's go back to the January 6th hearings because the January 6th committee I believe that the next hearing, you know, may be the committee's last and some are saying yes, others are saying no, but I believe that it may be the committee's last. And it seems like they still have a lot more of a story to tell. I mean, it's great. It's great viewership and all and it's interesting. But personally, I'd like to see them go after the tax.

It was first take place and Wednesday is now going to be rescheduled. We're told probably not next week, probably the week after a week after that, but certainly before the midterms is what we were hearing on Capitol Hill yesterday. And then after the midterms, the idea is the community's going to be working on its final report, not clear whether we're going to get an interim report anymore, but we will get a final report at some point. And we should probably expect a hearing surrounding the release of that report that makes recommendations and kind of patches the legislation to ensure that January 6 cannot happen again. So I think that that's kind of the rough timeline. In terms of what they're going to focus on in the next hearing, You know, the committee has been playing this very close to that chance. We know that they are going to feature some clips about eight minutes in total at various points in the hearing concerning Roger Stone. They traveled to Copenhagen.

No provision in the Constitution gives them the authority to regulate the Supreme Court period. He was commenting on recent efforts by Senate Democrats to impose ethics reform on the court.

It's worth far more than it's by the water. And it's near all that. And it's a commercial property. So there's that also. Let me be very clear. Donald Trump devalued Mar-a-Lago. That's one of the issues by saying that it was a commercial property and signing a deed that says that he intends to forever use it as a commercial property as a club. And all of these other easements that he attached to it and historical easements and other encumbrances took down the value. So he paid less property taxes. And Christina Bob the Trump organization, vice president who testified said that the Trump organization was the one who valued it at $27 million. It's not the judge.

And right now, like we talked about the last time I was on this show, Jersey Millennials, they're not only are they working for candidates running for office, but they are running for office at the local level, at the state level, for Congress in winning and in showing up and making change and keeping people engaged, especially our generation, in these fights on a daily basis. And so that's the positive change that I see both boards, people staying engaged, people not being bogged down by having to hear about fucking Kevin McCarthy all the time and saying, okay, well, I guess we're just going to have to give up this fight. and I don't really want to pay attention to politics anymore. These are people saying this is a dysfunctional Republican party, but in two years we'll have the opportunity to make sure that they never, that no Republican, because I don't know if Kevin McCarthy is even going to last, we'll have that speaker gamble for ever or for a very long time, and that we're going to relax to ever our Democratic nominee is, which I believe it's going to be President Biden running again.

But pretty soon, I think a lot of people are going to be seeing a lot more of Donald Trump. He's traveling to South Carolina. He's traveling to New Hampshire. He's traveling to Georgia after that horrific and boring speech. Honestly, just boring speech that he mainly announces is run. Again, you know, he was talking about the death penalty for anyone who sold drugs, whether that be illegal or illegally. It sounded like he was saying ridiculous things.

You can't get a mortgage because the bank requires that you have insurance, flood, wind, water, etc. You can't get those anymore. It's a real problem. But you know, I do, Jack, I want to talk to us on that you just brought up because it is fascinating. The fact that Trump is going to be back on Facebook. Will in any way increase his chances of winning back the American public? Because young people are not partial to Facebook. That I know. In fact, when I talk like to your generation, I talk to my kids about Facebook. They're like, face what? And by the way, they're like, and by the way, Michael, it's called meta, right?

Is that Republicans going to tear each other apart? It's going to be the most unpopular they have ever been, and it will tank their poll numbers.

First of all, NFTs aren't trading cards and you don't trade NFTs, you sell them. And then when you sell them, that the original only gets 5% of the so and it keeps going down. It's almost like an amway type of thing where the more people that do it, then everybody else shares and whatever profit, but there is no profit in NFTs anymore. In fact, the one that I think sold for like $75 million. Today is worth something like $1500. Oh, you know, that artificial inflation of the values of NFTs, it's not what it was expected.

Will it be a red, do you think that there'll be a red wave on November 8th, or will Democrats hold the line with abortion mobilizing turnout?  You know, what did the polls telling you? And you know one thing. I don't believe in the polls and says, ooh, right? There are many different ways and we'll talk about it that I think they should be doing it.

We are in a situation where all the political fundamentals six months ago were for a gigantic Republican sweep. I mean, top to bottom, we were going to lose everything. Inflation, gas prices, all that stuff. Since then, Dobbs and an abortion have reset the playing field somewhat. There's an argument being made right now that the Democrats met and peaked a little early. I'm not sure that's the case yet. I still think we're going to end up with a Republican House just based on the redistricting structures around the country and some ground level things in the congressional races. The Senate right now, I have to tell you, Michael, our modeling on the Senate is everything from a plus four Democratic win to a plus four Republican win. And it's the noise is so bad and the signal is so weak that, you know, it's hard to see where that's going to shake out. I do think in Pennsylvania, better than starting to open it up.

Avenatti came on like a hero, like a fucking white knight, one of those media darlings who star roses he pitted himself against Trump as part of the resistance. Avenatti and Daniels drew white attention and were held by some as a courageous if not unlikely pair, a plucky porn star and a pit bull lawyer who were not afraid to challenge a sitting president. They appeared together on television often, and Avenatti built the sizeable Twitter following, antagonizing the president and yours truly on his preferred platform. He hobnob with celebrities, and for a very brief moment, I mean a fucking brief moment, flirted with his own run for the presidency. Never mind that this was all done on borrowed wings and the courage of Stormy Daniels. Avenatti's a fucking fraud, a huckster. No better than the man",

It was a court case that went all the way to the Supreme Court and it was something that the former president and his lawyers desperately wanted to keep secret. We're now being told by multiple sources that have reviewed this initial tranche of records. that the phone records from the day of January 6th and also a supplemental diary that outlines the president's movements on that day show a period of time from around the time he came back from the White House until the time that he gave that speech from the Rose Garden where he does not take or receive any phone calls. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean he didn't take phone calls. In fact, there are reported examples of phone calls that he either made or took during that period of time, one to the House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, another to Senator Tommy Tupperville that came through Senator Mike Lee. But the point here is on these official White House records, which are supposed to be the keeper of this information during his administration, that period of time shows no record of any calls. So that does make the work of the January 6 committee just a little bit more complicated. They now have to figure out what the president was up to during that period of time as they try and paint the picture of this piece of history and exactly the role that the president played.",

Like, I think I kind of like that about him in terms of pointing out stupid. Like, there's a stop sign near my house, I hate, and I go through it all the time. And that's what he is. He blows through stop signs and some of them are dumb and so he points those out and at the other times he goes through things we really should have there and he also is showing that you can't stop like Trump does the same thing is like he he wanted a paper and oh well. But someone did it. No one stopped him. No one can do anything about it. He's pointing out how weak our laws are or how weak our fences are, I guess, in a lot of ways. And so one of the things I like about Elon is that he is correct. He's doing big things. He has big ideas. He's swinging for the fences. These ideas are important, whether it's space or hyperloop or cars or anything else. They're very worthy things to be working on. I think one of the things that people forget is Thomas Edison was also an asshole. Right? He really was.",

That's what Casey says. And then when you overturn Roe v. Wade, you allow total abortion bans, which is what Roe v. Wade said couldn't take place. When the Republicans are essentially now pretending, I mean, some of them are pretending basically what they support is what Roe v. Wade said, but they're too cowardly to actually say that. So then they support the total abortion bans. And Roe v Wade struck the balance. Roe v Wade recognized the complexity of the issue and addressed it in the 1970s. And then in 2022,",

I want to hit a few more quick stories before we bring in our guests because I'm so excited to bring in Adam Frish to talk about his race against Lauren Bober. But let's quickly head on, Kelly Lefler's text messages. So we're learning that Kelly Lefler was actually a witness before the special grand jury in Fulton County. And that's likely how these documents Worked their way into somebody's hands. The Atlanta Journal of Constitutions, the paper that broke the story, the individual who sent or individuals who sent those text messages also sent it to Politico and a few other outlets. Atlanta Journal of Constitutions confirmed first with the recipients that these were legit, but no one knows actually who the source. of these documents are, but 59 pages, which really just shows Kelly Lefler just being so cowardly. And that basically what she was worried about was that she was going to get booed. before a Trump rally. And so that's what convinced her that she would say that she was going to object to the results",

The message to these groups is that what happened was both good and righteous. And please come out and do it again, only in more cities with far more violence. If I wasn't mistaken, Trump has basically opened the door for a full-on insurgency. He is prepared to blackmail this country into setting him free or face the prospect of more violence and bloodshed in a city near you.

Because it's not just from Michael, the business mayor, rapper, activist, advocate to tell you, it is for me to be told by people who organize it on the ground, Courtney Seale's bear strong.

It is up for me to be informed by them so I can then say to politicians, this is what the people have gathered from an information standpoint. The second is personal commitment. How passed voting day? and I personally committed to this, and that means looking at my external and internal involvement to the non-violent campaign and preparing myself for a long-term action.

Even if you think you're connecting with a person, it's really actually not for them. It's really for you, right? And I could speak as someone who's from an obscure country or whatever, right? My family's from a small country, and these staff call comorose islands. Most people don't know where that country is, unless you have a really, really strong knowledge of this wahili coast, right? And so whenever people ask, oh, where are you from? I generally like, head it off immediately. You don't know it or whatever, right? But all of a sudden, everyone wants to become geography experts. Like, no, I have a really strong knowledge of Africa. I'm like, okay, sure, right? I'm from commercial islands. It's like, oh, wow. Yeah, that's near. Uh, Ethiopia, right? No, it's not, right? You know what I mean? And now we're doing this whole thing, right? Where You want to play a trivia game with me, right? And I'm like, I wasn't here to play a trivial pursuit, right?
