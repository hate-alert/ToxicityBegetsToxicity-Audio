That's a plausible scenario. More plausible than the fucking J6 committee. But anyway, their point was that Don egged them on and made them do it. And this video was put on Twitter and immediately taken down. So, it is my belief that the DNC orchestrated J6, they opened the doors, they pushed everyone to riot. And again, as Joe Biggs' lawyer says, that's no excuse. You know, you still have to have some culpability. But the DNC worked very hard to foment this riot and blame it on Trump. So when Trump said, don't riot, they had to delete it. So they called Twitter and said, take this down. And Twitter obliged.",

FOP Metals is another new sponsor to the show, another proud sponsor of the show. And their direction with the imminent plummeting economy is to invest in precious metals. Silver, gold, these things are tangible. Could they go down? Yes, plausibly they could go down. They're not going down. They're a finite thing. I wish the Federal Reserve was contingent on precious metals. That's the way it should be. That's the way it was. And when we left the idea of attaching the American dollar to gold. the economy started going down the toilet. And now what's happening? Biden is printing money like the movie Idiocracy. Inflation is at nine percent. It's very likely our dollar will be worth nothing soon.",

It's 10 bucks a month and it's more content than you could possibly handle. Probably five hours a day. When I first started this I said free content every day and it wasn't quite every day. You had to sort of parse some to make it every day. Now it's five hours a day. So, more content than you could possibly handle, all totally honest, totally unfiltered, horrific, offensive, we make mistakes, we correct them, it's all over the map, it's nothing like anything else in the media.

They've got the jewel, they've got the cartridges, they've got the gummies. The gummies are fun to take just before you go to bed and you go to the movies. Bring a box of popcorn if you're going to sleep on gummies because Your dreams are fascinating. They have the organic tincture that you put in your coffee to take the edge off. They have the topical that you put on your sore muscles after a hard day working out. Or ladies, you put on your feet if you're going to be wearing heels all night. Yeah, you heard me. It takes the pain away. It's truly evidence that God wanted you to get involved in weed. He doesn't necessarily want you to get high. Okay, that's a bummer. I'll take the THC out.

Worst case scenario, and the most likely scenario is, they take these balls, they get the signature, they go to eBay. So the pro baseball player who's making $10 million a year is like, why do I work part time making you money? It's fun to do it for kids, not just because it's a nice thing, but it's economically viable because you get kids young. They're interested in the game. It's a good investment into the sport. It's why I go to spring training. I don't really care about the games, but I want my kids to get their balls signed. There are baseballs.

So when you look at what the Christian right was asking for, it'd be very similar to food labels. In other words, a food label can't say, this is 40 grams of sugar when it's actually 80 grams of sugar. Christian conservatives were just saying, it needs to say 80 grams of sugar because we're parents and maybe my kid's a diabetic. That's the issue that happened there. Now, they're just trying to literally drown out voices with whom they disagree. By that same token, You know it used to be people on the left who were everything was bitches and whores right the objective it wasn't christian conservatives who objectified women but now we're accused of objectify by saying she's very pretty she's a very pretty woman and i guarantee you know who else is saying that every single straight male and objective female watching right now comment below comment below is that and i don't mean in any type of an inappropriate way is that not a more attractive Woman then",

This is the same thing here when we're talking about not only the stock market But we're talking about the disconnect between Americans and their everyday lives their employment opportunities versus a stock market They were congruent under Donald Trump people were doing better wages went up an average of I think the average wage went up about $5,000 in the first three years under Barack Obama was 1,000 under eight years so wages went up and the stock market was doing well right now you have home prices and  Skyrocketing. And you have the stock market going up, but you don't have any jobs being added. And you're saying, some jobs? No. Zero jobs. Negative 4 million jobs. We're still missing 4 million jobs, but the stock market is still going up, and home prices are still going up. That's the disconnect. That's what's dangerous. Now, the only silver lining, and I don't want this to happen at the expense of Americans, unfortunately it already is, is that you can have this conversation right now at home with your family, with your friends. They know what they're experiencing. They can see the disconnect. You just need to point it out for them.",

He knew where the mic was. That wasn't a hot mic moment, that was a bend over and spank moment.

Not the most dangerous. The most venomous snake in the world. Do you know why America is better than most countries? It can sort of be boiled down to snakes. Do you know how many people die from snake bites in the United States each year? Approximately. I'm going by road here, but I know I'm within striking distance. It's like 5 to 10. You know how many across the globe? It's well into the hundreds of thousands. It's a minimum of 80,000. in Asia every year. Often well over 100,000 in Asia. The big four, they call them these snakes. Now, here's the issue. It's because they live in countries where they don't have advanced medical technology like we do, anti-venom. They don't take care of their own citizens, and a lot of them still have to work in these primarily agrarian societies, or as we would know them, third world countries. So, they don't survive what we survive here, and they have more venomous snakes, to be clear, in Asia. Most venomous? Comment below. Don't cheat. Don't cheat. Don't cheat. Don't cheat. They're cheating. It's the inland Taipan. Taipan, sorry. From Australia. Yeah, there's also the coastal Taipan. Also a dick, but not as venomous. So this is why all snakes should be killed.

In comment below, hit like, too, if you agree. Hey, we should take care of our own people first. That's only a novel concept to people really since the 1960s to today. The idea that if you are a superpower, you need to be taking care of the rest of the world, as opposed to, at gunpoint, raping them of their resources. That's kind of how empires existed beforehand. I don't know if you know this, evil empires are generally profitable, not costly. So, um... This is my problem with what Biden is doing. Of course, he had no comment. Now he's trying to lean too far the other way with the Maui fires. Horrible tragedy. Obviously, the death toll is now over 100. My heart's go out to those families affected. Okay.

No, no, no, it's not your check. Now here's the math that you need. So Ukrainians apparently need the money more, because he's committed, former Vice President Biden, over $113 billion to Ukraine, and counting. That's over $2,500 per person in Ukraine or an RPG7 for every single Ukrainian man, woman, and child. I never know when those are going to come in handy. Yes.

Johnson pleaded guilty, pled guilty, received 21 months in federal prison. 21 months in federal prison. The U.S. attorney said of that case, studies amply demonstrate the connection between chronic drug abuse and violent crime and illuminate the nexus between Congress's attempt to keep firearms away from habitual drug abusers and its goal of reducing violent crime.

It's the fact that he doesn't even care or have any concern that you might be able to go to the tail of the tape to verify that he's lying.

We've got a quote here from the National Review. A New York State Supreme Court judge on Monday ruled that Governor Kathy Hochul's mask mandate for schools and other public locations is unconstitutional. Judge Thomas Rademacher found that the governor and the state health commissioner did not have the authority to enact a mask mandate without the state legislature given that the governor no longer has emergency powers. The mask mandate has been in place since mid-December when the state saw a surge in the highly transmissible Omicron variant. There can be no question that every person in this state wishes, wants, and prays that this era of COVID ends soon and that they will surely do their part to see that it is accomplished, Rademacher wrote in his decision. However, enacting any laws to this end is entrusted solely to the state legislature. While the intentions of Commissioner Bassett and Governor Hochul appear to be well-aimed, squarely at doing what they believe is right to protect the citizens of New York State, they must take their case to the state legislature. That's a pretty clear explanation of what's going on here. Now, I will add that at the end there, you're",

I do think these people honestly get off on ruining lives. I think they get off on the power of knowing that they can keep people in masks, that they can shut down businesses. I really do. But let's put the motives aside. The basis of the decision there is that the governor is not the king. Just because the governor wants to do something, you can't do it. This is what separation of powers is all about. The governor is supposed to be the chief executive of the state the way the president is the chief executive of the country. The president is not supposed to make laws. We have the legislature to make laws, right? This is basic civics 101. I know you guys know all of this stuff.

They were all good citizens, and they behaved all day long, and you get a cookie, and you're good, meaning you put the mask on, you sat there quietly, you didn't talk, you never said hi to a neighbor anymore, or any of those things. We destroyed so much of the fabric of our societies, and we did it because we were all policing ourselves, and there just wasn't enough of us willing to say enough is enough. So that's the sad part about it, but then the beautiful part is people don't want to live like this anymore. And finally one person did something and one person's decision started freeing the people. And dare I link this back to that Moses guy and the Passover story. I think there's a little something there. I really do, and dare I link this back to Elon Musk fighting Twitter and the machine. One guy can do something. The judge's name, by the way, is Judge Katherine Kimball Mazzell. She is 35 years old. She is a young lady. She is a Trump-appointed judge, and she, God bless that woman, I wanna meet that woman. We're going to the courthouse tomorrow.

Well, everyone else wants to get rid of it. We're trying to figure it out. But imagine if he, as a CEO, would have just said, hey, me and my airline, we're not going to comply.

And they really have done such a disservice, um, by not being square with people, not being honest with people and, you know, kind of pursuing a noble lie strategy where, you know, Fauci and other people would say, uh, you know, like masks are useless, don't wear masks. And then they, you know, admit later, oh, well, we didn't want people to buy Personal, you know ppe because we might have needed it for other people, you know we learned now that there was a stockpile of n95 masks that that government was holding on to until recently and it's kind of like Wasn't this the emergency that you pull out all the stops the cdc and the fda especially when it came to Kind of uh, really fast tracking vaccines. They put it vaccines into one process, but they still took their time To kind of really hustle through all of the safety requirements and everything.",

They decided to willingly partner with this clothing manufacturer to make Pride Month gear that includes bathing suits that are, quote, tuck friendly, that have extra material around the crotch, which no woman needs because we don't have penises down south in Rio. We don't need extra material and we don't need tuck friendly. But the Target CEO is out there defending this, saying, look, the extra crotch wear and the tuck friendly bathing suits are important. that this whole line in the pride department is a good business decision. It's the right thing for society. That's why they decided to do it. But if you look at the individual targets across America, they're feeling the wrath of the consumer. So much so that Fox News reported yesterday that states like South Carolina, Georgia, the more southern, more conservative states are now having to move the entire display into the back corners because they've had so many irate customers. I'm sure it includes a lot of parents going in there saying, Get this out of here. I don't want to look at it.

No, we don't want to do that. So here's what they say, for the record. Mike Rinder is not just a liar, but an inveterate liar, an inveterate liar who seeks to profit from his dishonesty. He's admitted under oath to lying and wrote of how he lies about lying. His self-aggrandizing memoir, in quotes, is little more than a compendium of discredited claims, gross exaggerations, and provable lies. There was no due diligence of the book, and it was not fact-checked by Simon & Schuster or anyone else. For 15 years, Rinder has distorted and manipulated his truth for anyone willing to pay him. His version of events has repeatedly been rejected by the courts, with one court recently finding Rinder's testimony, quote, is filled with unsupported assumptions, foundational deficiencies, irrelevant matters, improper opinions, and arguments, end quote. And then finally, The book excludes Rinder's admitted gross malfeasance and dishonesty in the church that caused him to be stripped of authority and ultimately expelled. He excludes his cold, callous treatment of his family, particularly his children, including discarding them with no notice after more than 30 years.\" Okay, so that's what they think of you.

There was a noise complaint at the house at one point and the police come around to the back of the house and Kaylee comes out And they have this discussion and she's so respectful to the police officer. And again, that was just another one I was so sad watching because it was just like you remember college when the police would come to a party, and you could just tell she was a really good kid. The way she was, you know, telling Yes, sir, to the police officer, we will let it happen again. And all those videos, it's so easy to get caught up in all the documents in the case.

But the soft on crime policies played a massive role as well. And certainly the defund the police And the summary attacks on police as racist in the wake of George Floyd did not help either. I mean, there've been whole studies on the Ferguson effect, so-called Ferguson effect. Cops do pull back when they don't get backing, when they get demonized. They're like, what am I doing this for? I'm not making $300,000 a year.

Those were mass shootings, there's no question about that. But now you start to hear CNN, you read the New York Times, you listen to the Biden White House, some Democrat politicians, they describe everything as a mass shooting, like four people shot at the grocery store or wherever.

That's a gang problem. It's a crime problem. Crime has been out of control and you've got a decarceral DA named Kim Foxxer who's pushing the same policies as Gascon in LA or Boudin in San Francisco. So they're absolutely trying to rebrand let's say heinous but conventional murders, violence, gang violence as some sort of mass shooting to put it in a different category. They never expressed a concern about these crimes until Uvalde. Now, Uvalde is a separate thing. We do have a problem of these young, disturbed, psychotic young men who go off and do these mass shootings, who kill, you know, dozens of people. Those are a problem. But that and we can have a conversation about how to control that on our pod. We talked about red flag laws. We talked about background checks. I'm in favor of those things.

The question that we're trying to answer is how do we make sure that those who are voting actually care about what they're voting for and aren't just voting because of social pressures or tribal celebrity reasons or otherwise? Which brings me to this story. Gen Z for change. You saw the title of this video. My friends, a Gen Z Democrat was owned so bad on social media that his heart started racing and he was, he admitted himself to the emergency room. And so this brings me back to the point about Vivek Ramaswamy. Yo, if Gen Z wants change, but they are so frail that when they engage in conversation, they have to rush themselves to the emergency room. Gen Z y'all are not confidence building. To be fair, I really detest this Gen Z for change thing. You don't speak for all of Generation Z, dude. You speak for progressive activists. That's it. But that's the game they're trying to play.

And there's this dude over here, he's working out, and he glances over a couple times. First of all, if you're an attractive female and a guy glances over at you, bro, he's not saying anything to you. He's not bothering you. And you're not even looking the same direction. That's the crazy thing. But also consider this, ladies filming herself in the gym doing hip thrusts. Now, somebody might just be like, I wonder what they're doing. They put the camera down, they're filming themselves, like what's this all about? And she goes on to assume that this guy is like, what's he creeping on her about?

And she used to run the book review section, and she used to be married to fellow New York Times columnist Brett Stevens. She has quietly become possibly the worst of the New York Times op-ed writers. And she has a piece today with the title, What Liberals Can Learn From Ron DeSantis. And it is exactly what you would expect. It starts with saying, oh, well, we shouldn't underestimate DeSantis. Nobody is underestimating Ron DeSantis. We wouldn't be talking about him all the fucking time if we were underestimating him. We're talking about him because we think he's scary and that there is a not zero percent chance that he could be president of the United States. The main part in this that really got to me was she describes his approach to education as a maverick approach. We all know that in America and in American politics that is a compliment. John McCain famously traded on that nickname for decades, and it showed his independent streak and how he wasn't beholden to corporate interests, you know, except",

This is the New York Times giving cover to Ron DeSantis for his blatant censorship of school libraries, of history, of what kids are being taught in schools.

Let me say that again, just so folks get it. There was a piece of legislation that was going to stop and restrict children from carrying guns without adult supervision in public, because according to Democratic Representative Donna Berenger, she said this, her district wanted the ban so that they could, quote, stop 14 year olds walking down the middle of the street in the city of St. Louis carrying AR-15s.

And his name is Elon Musk. You've probably read about him. Mm, mm, mm, mm. He found himself in a little bit of trouble on his own platform, Twitter, the other day. A guy from Iceland, I will just call him Holly, he is a senior director of Twitter, and he tweeted that his computer access to Twitter had been cut off nine days ago, but he never got any notification that he was fired or anything like that. In a tweet to Elon, he said that your head of HR can't confirm whether I'm an employee or not. And Musk replied to him and said, what work have you been doing? And Holly explained the work he'd been doing. And then Musk didn't believe him and said, Pixar, it didn't happen. And he then went on to tweet that Holly quote, did no actual work and claimed as an excuse that he had a disability that prevented him from typing. So at this point, Holly was like, okay, here's the deal. I have muscular dystrophy.",

You also revealed that he had a disability, which is probably a violation of a lot of HR laws. Oh, by the way, it turned out that according to this guy's contract, if he was ever fired, he was owed that $100 million straight up. Within a little bit after that, Musk took to Twitter to say, I would like to apologize to Hallie for my misunderstanding of this situation. It was based on things I was told that were untrue or in some cases true, but not meaningful.

Of course, there are fortifications throughout the West in some cases that still exist that were set up to defend these supposed hardy settlers against the natives. Part of that propaganda and we don't really go into this in the book.  It's one of the things that perhaps we could have explored a little more, but didn't, was that our whole mythology of the rugged settler kind of depends in part on believing that there was a pristine landscape. In other words, nobody was there. It was free for the taking, except that we also know that that wasn't really true. And so that belief system depends on another mythology, another whole set of mythologies we don't engage in, which is the myth of the empty frontier.",

It sure looks to me like market fundamentalism is at least wobbling pretty strongly because neither political party in the U.S. believes in it anymore. It's still, I think, somewhat of a centrist position. But I think because of both right and left reject it, what's going to be really interesting to see is what comes out of this, what kind of new hybrid capitalism we get.  I'm a historian. My job is to figure out the past and not figure out the future. So I don't know where it's going to go, but you're not the first person to ask me that question. I don't think market fundamentalism is very healthy right now, but I also can't count it out because it's so strongly held as an American belief.  And it's not just by the political classes, right? The whole point of our story is that it's been sold to all of us as individuals. And there's still enormous numbers of Americans that believe in it.",

I've decided not to just make it a person, but an entire state, as one is doing in these divided states of America that we are living in. So Idaho takes the fucking cake this week. Idaho, which according to the Huffington Post already has some of the most extreme abortion restrictions on the books, has passed a new piece of legislation, House Bill 242, which is expected to also sail through the Republican held Senate. And this is what the bill seeks to do, Andy. It seeks to limit minors' ability to travel for abortion care without parental consent. The legislation would create a whole new crime, dubbed, quote, abortion trafficking, which is defined in the bill as a, quote, adult who, with the intent to conceal an abortion from the parents or guardian of a pregnant unemancipated minor, either procures an abortion or obtains an abortion-inducing drug for that minor. Recruiting, harboring, or transporting the pregnant minor within the state commits the crime of abortion trafficking. Let me tell you",

So they are claiming, no, this is just for within Idaho, which of course is a lie because you already can't get abortions in Idaho, basically. But there's some fear that because it doesn't specifically talk about traveling to other  it may somehow pass constitutional muster, which, look, seems insane to me.

He served eight years for shooting an Afghan civilian in the head in 2010. Wait, what? Yeah. He shot a 27-year-old man in the head during an interrogation. He was a National Guard member, according to another National Guard member.

He then left Muhammad's body in a latrine, which you don't do in the military. And he served eight years in prison for this.

Look, as I said earlier in the show, I am not the most economically savvy or financially savvy guy in the world. And even I know that James Cramer has become a punch line for people doing the opposite of what he says. And last month he said Silicon Valley Bank, he recommended it as a buy that people should buy stock in Silicon Valley Bank at three hundred twenty dollars a share. Probably as you're listening to this, that bank is no more. It has been shut down by regulators. And this is what he does. So he gets a fuck you for just apparently giving the worst advice of any possible financial advisor in the world. But I think my bigger fuck you is to CNBC for continuing to employ this guy. It's like, what are you doing? Like you are supposed to be a network that sort of guides people correctly, one would hope, as to how to invest or, you know, give them the proper strategies for investment and let them know what's",

I didn't know this, but right before we went to air, Jesse Cannon, our producer, told me that there was a Twitter account, a bot, I think, that just picks the opposite of everything that Jim Cramer says and apparently substantially out-earns him with its picks. So why do you have that guy in the air? I understand, you know, he's been around for forever and he hosts this show Mad Money that I guess is a popular show on CNBC because people find him to be an entertaining guy. But is that your point? Is that, again, this gets into Fox News territory. Like, is your point to entertain or is your point to enlighten people and inform people? And with Fox News, we know it's not to inform people. It's an entertainment channel for people who like to have their priors confirmed. But CNBC is not supposed to be that. And this, you know, particular show and this particular guy seems to be exactly that. This is just a guy who is wrong far more often than he's",

I mean, let's let's start with a state like Pennsylvania, where Republicans had to take in the state, Pennsylvania would have been a state that may have had a ban on abortion. A Republican was certainly considering that, and they lost that election. You know, that protects the status quo in certain states. It will also allow Democrats in some places to strengthen abortion rights, potentially even help people who are coming out of states in a place like Colorado, in a place like Minnesota, you know, places that are surrounded by states or have states around them where abortion is banned, it's going to be interesting now to see what a Democratic majority in Minnesota does when it considers that as an issue. That's an issue where the importance of maybe Minnesota flipping blue resonates outside of itself because states, again, that have bans just next to Minnesota, if the laws are strengthened in Minnesota, that could affect how easy it is to keep having some sort of access.

On criminal justice reform, I mean, one of what's very interesting in across the states that I discussed, Republicans were really focused on using crime as an attack against Democrats. Again, maybe nowhere more so than Pennsylvania. And I say that because they staged this sort of theatrical impeachment against the reform DA of Philadelphia this fall, which didn't really have any particular purpose because it was sort of dead on arrival in the state Senate because it didn't have the vote. But Republicans did this elaborate theater around Krasner's impeachment to really put the issue of crime on the agenda and think that that was going to result in a tough on crime backlash. Obviously, that was also a huge issue in the federal Senate race between Fetterman and Oz, where that was really at the center of the attacks against Fetterman. And Fetterman won, and Democrats flipped the State House by gaining, I believe, 12 seats in the statehouse. And we saw that elsewhere as well, where candidates who ran on reform did actually quite well and tough on crime attacks didn't win the day",

His belief is that if you have been raped, if you've been a victim of rape, if you've been a victim of incest, you should have to go in front of a group of people in your community, outside of the, quote, outside of the jurisdiction of the federal government, and tell them what happened to you, and then they get to decide what you do with your body, whether or not you have to bring that child to term, whether or not you have the right to any bodily autonomy whatsoever. It is, I mean, it's dystopian, it is apocalyptic, and it just betrays an entire disregard for not just, you know, women's bodies and pregnant people's bodies, but the ability for those people to make choices. Why on earth would someone in the community be better equipped to know whether or not I should get an abortion than I am?",

And this is something I think we may see in the coming years with Trumpism, anti-vax, QAnon, big lie. When they suffer defeats in the courts, when leaders of those movements end up indicted and convicted, as we may see with some of our big lie-promoting people in the next year or two, all of a sudden, defeat takes a lot of the fun and action out of lying. It's fun to be a liar when it seems like all you do is get away with it, and there's a lot of excitement in it. But when people start to lose, it loses its appeal.

So, you know, we see a trajectory where lies and liars are in ascendancy at the beginning, and it can take a long time for the truth to catch up to the lies. And it doesn't always, right? I mean, lies sometimes, sometimes the liars have the upper hand forever. So there's no guarantee. That's an important thing to understand.

And I made that mistake too, frankly, by the way. I think in one of the first things I wrote, I used the term raid and then I thought about it. But I think the larger issue is that Donald Trump is a habitual liar and sensationalist and conventional media norms around covering someone who lies all the time. And then as a network of people around him who immediately after an event also lie and use the same talking points, if you have to cover that event, One, how do you cover it by telling the truth, which is that they're misrepresenting what occurred and they're trying to propagandize it, which is the correct way to cover it, as opposed to Trump says this, but law enforcement says that.

But the most important thing I learned in my life, this took me a decade to learn, and I learned it through the litigation process of discovery is that we don't keep secrets. The difference between us and them is they do keep secrets about what they do and how they behave. So in the litigation process, in the depositions, I had nothing to hide. They had everything to hide. So they stopped suing us. The only thing we do keep secret, Mark, is the names of some of our informants and the names of our donors. The names of donors is a freedom of association right under the U.S. Constitution established in the NAACP case in 1958. We will fight that tooth and nail to never reveal the names of our donors.

Instead, get a brand new iPhone 12 from Pure Talk for just $12 a month at 0% interest, no contract. Cancel or leave anytime. Get a new iPhone, ultra-fast 5G service, and cut your cell phone bill in half. That's why I'm a Pure Talk customer. That's why you",

Now, that quickly gets law enforcement into locked campus doors during active shooter incidents. Now, tragically, U.S. school shootings continue with devastating outcomes, 18 tragedies occurring in the first three months of this year alone. Now the Knox Company has been trusted by first responders since 1975, and with their new advanced electronic e-key technology, local, state, federal law enforcement, they can access locked doors during crisis situations. Now statistics illustrate the need and the importance for all schools to install this invaluable resource. A Knox entry system can be installed and managed by the school or their district, Now parents and grandparents, it's important that you ask your child's school if they have installed a Knox Entry system. Learn more about Knox Entry when you go to their website. It's schoolentry, one word, dot com, schoolentry.com. Do it today.

And this is why it goes so far beyond politics. Remember when people thought COVID possibly could have originated in a lab in China when it first broke out? Senator Tom Cotton was one of the first people to surmise that was a possibility. What did the media do? It called it a conspiracy theory. It said there's no way. It called it lunacy.

All of a sudden then, the Washington Post changed its headlines on Tom Cotton's story to reflect that it could actually have happened. This is the problem, Sean. When Donald Trump was president, the press actively suppressed news that they didn't like. As soon as Joe Biden became president and his people said the exact same information, reporters, reporters kind of nodded their head, go, oh, yes, I see what you mean. Yes, it's possible. This is the problem the press has. And this is why more than half the country doesn't trust them at all. And things are doing such a bad job, which is a real problem. We need media. When they put something on the air, we can all, all Americans, I don't care if you're liberal or conservative, can go, all right, that's a fact.

There's nothing to discuss, because both sides know that the treaty, the so-called guarantees for security that the Russians submitted are unmeetable.

He needs nappy time to recover. And then he calls, just before my show, he called Peter Doocy, and Peter broke it on Hannity, and his answer was, well, it was nothing personal, pal.

So, you know, the first event I went to, I obviously, you guys know this, the viewers I know know this, but I was assaulted by one of his staffers who tried to grab my phone while I was, again, not disrupting, my good friend Alex Stein, that's his thing. It's not my thing. I don't do that. I was literally silently filming a question being asked, which again was a tough question. They seem to not want Beto to have to answer because they know he's a horrible candidate. They're that insecure. They know he can't answer the questions. They don't want the viral moment. And so instead they assault me. They use DPD as their mafia muscle to get rid of me. And then the next event I go to, they're berating me. they're calling me crazy they're calling me a stalker again because I waited quietly and wanted to ask him a question okay so violence committed against me trying to box out their political opposition okay so let's fast forward to this event when I have audio coming soon of one of the Beto campaign members, Beto Staffers, saying that she wants to stab me and shank me, which is just lovely,",

And a trans youth mental health researcher who writes for the New York Times opinion section, he tweeted the other day, quote, puberty blockers, temporary, reversible. And by the way, the evidence is not that puberty blockers are temporary and reversible. That is not what the evidence shows. There are serious open questions about long-term health effects of puberty blockers. He says, puberty blockers are more benign than going through a puberty that cannot be undone. If you go through puberty, you see, you should be able to be so independent of your own biological sex. And if you go through puberty, that is your body doing violence to you, the secret Cartesian you that lives in your head. So puberty is more damaging to you than puberty blockers, and then maybe carving a fake vagina into your body. If you can't see that, then you really need to reflect on your biases and whether you consider trans people at all when you form your opinions.

She replied, quote, I don't like my boobs growing and Reddit says I'm probably trans. That night, I tracked down these Reddit exchanges and my jaw dropped when I saw how many people and organizations were heavily pushing the possibility of her being trans.

Many older transgender folks share these concerns, too. He says, transgenderism, and I say, he, she. She says, transgenderism isn't a vague feeling or a distaste for stereotypical roles. It's a serious internal condition that causes you to want to become a member of the opposite sex. Medical transition, such as the kind I went through, can enhance an illusion that helps some gender dysphoric individuals navigate the world with more comfort. It did for me, it was the right path for me, but. I wasn't born in the wrong body. I was born female, but I didn't like it. So I changed my appearance at significant monetary, psychological and physical costs with plastic surgery and hormones. My sex never changed, though. Only my appearance changed. Anyone going through this is in store for a brutal process.

The puberty blockers have left her with a micro penis. She has to get part of her vagina made with her colon. While one of her friends had that surgery, even years later, it smells fairly colon-like. Obviously, my daughter is now distraught. She's in counseling, but is becoming worse and worse in her mental state, and I am frantic. On top of this, she has never had any sexual function, no urges, no erections, even when she tried masturbation to see if she could stimulate herself, nothing.

Politicians are campaigning for reelection on promises to stand up to Disney and other woke corporations.

Fans and park workers protested outside the company's headquarters earlier this month. Others have used social media to call for boycotts against Disney's parks. Disney is now going silent.

When she did this, the world, of course, erupted. The left went after her to attack her. She's now doing events at campuses. You and I talked about this before the show. She was going to be doing an event in San Francisco at a university there. That event didn't get to happen because the left started to attack her physically. A man hit her apparently twice. Police had to barricade her in a room as they basically rushed her from the stage. She was held in that room, barricaded with the cops for about an hour. And the student body that was coming after her said some of those horrific things to her as a woman. And if we wanted to bleep it all out, you wouldn't hear anything but a big long bleep. We decided we're going to let you see this. I wanted to warn, and you wanted to as well, if you have kids listening, kids",

If a biological woman wants to compete against men, nobody would care. If someone from the WNBA wants to compete in the NBA, great. That'd be amazing to watch. There's a reason we have a WNBA. because there is no woman on the face of the planet who could stop LeBron James. There may not be a man on the planet, but there is a reason there are real and material differences between the genders and so Riley Gaines was on campus and she's at San Francisco State University and she's there to speak and there's a violent protest and she says that she was physically hit twice by a biological man who now claims he's a woman.
